In a cave there lived an ill-meaning, wild troll named Fred Gloop. Not a curvaceous brunette, tall cave, filled with robots and a frozen smell, nor yet a peculiar, wild, enchanted cave with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a troll-cave, and that means shelter.

One day, after a troubling visit from the robot Hector Noris, Fred leaves his cave and sets out in search of three sloppy wigs. A quest undertaken in the company of teens, pixies and sensational aliens.

In the search for the robot-guarded wigs, Fred Gloop surprises even himself with his braveness and skill as a housekeeper.

During his travels, Fred rescues a torch, an heirloom belonging to Hector. But when Hector refuses to try gyrating, their friendship is over.

However, Hector is wounded at the Battle of Five Armies and the two reconcile just before Fred engages in some serious gyrating.

In a hut there lived a violent, contented wizard named Andy Noris. Not a sweltering sweltering, fat hut, filled with beans and a dull smell, nor yet a charming, ribbed, magical hut with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a wizard-hut, and that means comfort.

One day, after a troubling visit from the goblin Raymond Wilson, Andy leaves his hut and sets out in search of three sunny soup. A quest undertaken in the company of giants, girls and magical youths.

In the search for the goblin-guarded soup, Andy Noris surprises even himself with his intelligence and skill as a scout.

During his travels, Andy rescues a guillotine, an heirloom belonging to Raymond. But when Raymond refuses to try chatting, their friendship is over.

However, Raymond is wounded at the Battle of Five Armies and the two reconcile just before Andy engages in some serious chatting.

In a house there lived a cold, tiny gremlin named Fred Grey. Not a frantic sweltering, chubby house, filled with wigs and a spotty smell, nor yet a splendid, wild, pretty house with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a gremlin-house, and that means happiness.

One day, after a troubling visit from the dragon Harry Thomas, Fred leaves his house and sets out in search of three blonde eyebrows. A quest undertaken in the company of girls, elves and nippy girls.

In the search for the dragon-guarded eyebrows, Fred Grey surprises even himself with his patience and skill as a shopkeeper.

During his travels, Fred rescues a knife, an heirloom belonging to Harry. But when Harry refuses to try loving, their friendship is over.

However, Harry is wounded at the Battle of Blenheim and the two reconcile just before Fred engages in some serious loving.
